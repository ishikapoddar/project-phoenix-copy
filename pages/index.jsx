/* This is a React functional component that renders the home page of a website for a community of
competitive programming enthusiasts. It imports several components from other files, including a
carousel, a home redirect, and a FAQ section. It also uses the `Head` component from Next.js to set
the title of the page. The component returns JSX code that defines the layout and content of the
home page. */
