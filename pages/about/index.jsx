        <p className='text-xl sm:text-base text-center'>Welcome to CP Unofficial, an open community dedicated to competitive programming enthusiasts! We are a group of students from NITR who are passionate about programming and have come together to create a community for like-minded individuals to connect and collaborate.
        At CP Unofficial, we believe that programming is not just a hobby, but a way of life. Our goal is to create a community where everyone can learn from each other, grow together, and have fun while doing it. Whether you are a beginner just starting out or a seasoned pro, we welcome you to join us on this journey. <br /><br />

        Our community is focused on competitive programming, which is a sport that involves solving complex algorithmic problems under time pressure. Through regular contests, practice sessions, and discussions, we aim to provide a platform for our members to improve their skills and prepare for competitions.
        We understand that learning can be challenging, and that is why we have created a friendly and supportive environment where members can help each other out. Our members are always available to answer questions, provide guidance, and share their knowledge. <br /><br />

        We launched CP Unofficial in January 2021, and since then, we have grown into a vibrant community with members from all over the college. We have hosted several successful contests, workshops, and webinars, and we are constantly looking for new ways to improve and serve our members better. <br /><br />

        We are excited about the future of CP Unofficial, and we invite you to be a part of our community. Join us today and take the first step towards becoming a better programmer!</p>
