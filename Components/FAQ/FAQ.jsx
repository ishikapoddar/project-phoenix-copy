      question: "What is competitive Programming?",
      answer:
        `Competitive Programming is a mental sport where the contestants called sport programmers have to solve coding problems using maths, data structures and algorithms with various restrictions like memory limit, execution time within a set time limit. They are judged on the basis of output produced, execution time and program size.`,
    },
    {
      question: "What is most important for competitive programming?",
      answer:
        "Competitive programming is a field that requires a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, as well as the ability to think logically and solve problems efficiently.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which language is mostly used in competitive programming?",
      answer:
        `Here are the 5 most-preferred languages that developers use for competitive programming:
        C++,
        Java,
        Python,
        Kotlin,
        Ruby.`
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between CP and DSA?",
      answer:
        "DSA is all about solving real-world problems mainly using programming concepts that are vaguely related to computer science. CP is a mind sport to train your brain, get better at problem-solving and critical thinking; you should try competitive programming.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can we do CP without DSA?",
      answer:
        "DSA in depth is required when you want to learn computer science, not programming. Understand the difference, computer science is the theory - programming is practical. Be aware of things that exist, algorithms that exist, and data structures that exist.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does CP help in placements?",
      answer:
        "Yes, competitive programming is necessary for freshers. It helps them to improve their skills in a short span of time. This will assist them to land a better job and increase their chances of being chosen in an interview.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I be strong in competitive programming?",
      answer:
        `Pick a Programming Language. Comprehend the Concepts of Time and Space Complexity. Study Data Structures and Algorithms Fundamentals. Participate in Coding Challenges and Solve Coding Problems.`,
